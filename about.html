        Hello, Lone! I’m so happy I met you. Honestly, just being near you made my heart race—I could truly feel your presence.
      </p>

      <p class="animated-text">
        I know I was shaking a little—that was my first time seeing a beautiful girl like you. Every little thing about that moment felt unforgettable.
      </p>

      <p class="animated-text">
        And about that chocolate I gave you… I gave it with all my heart. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed seeing you smile when you received it.
      </p>

      <h2 class="animated-text">My Tech World</h2>
      <p class="animated-text">
        Beyond my feelings for that day, I’m passionate about coding, exploring new ideas, and creating experiences that connect people. But meeting you reminded me that the best connections happen in real life.
      </p>

      <h2 class="animated-text">My Message to You</h2>
      <p class="animated-text">
        I wish to see you again, to share more moments, laughter, and smiles. That day left a lasting impression on me, and I hope this page gives you a little sense of how I felt.
